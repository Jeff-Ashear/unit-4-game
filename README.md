# unit-4-game

Readme for unit-4-game:

This assignment appears to function almost as intended.  My goals were:
  -to get the buttons to function correctly when clicked(accomplished)
  -to get the buttons to generate new random numbers each round(unaccomplished)
  -to get the game's win and loss conditions to function(accomplished)
  -to get the game to generate a new random number each round(accomplished)
  -to get the entire gamestate to reset if the user chooses not to try again (accomplished)
  -to produce an attractive, clear layout that is pleasant to look at and easy to understand (I think accomplished, but this is                   somewhat subjective)
  -to produce a responsive layout which remains clear and attractive on different sized displays(nearlyh accomplished)
  -to streamline the code, avoiding unnecessary repetition and too much length(unaccomplished)
  
  
Questions I have after doing this assignment:

1. I had a terrible time trying to call the randomRange function when win/loss conditions were met.  I think I was having a scope problem but I'm not sure.  While I was able to fix it by redefining the randomNumberVariable within the win/loss function, I'm almost certain that there is a more efficient way to do this.

2. I also failed to get the each buttons' random number to reset each round.  I believe this too was related to variable scope.  This and the above issue lead me to believe that I don't really understand how to call functions in the context of scope.
